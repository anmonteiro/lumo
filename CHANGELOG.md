# Changelog

## [master](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/compare/1.8.0-beta...HEAD) (unreleased)

### New features

- Remove #_=> from pasted code ([#261](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/261)).
- Allow CLJS require from `node_modules` ([#130](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/130)).

### Bug fixes

- lumo.compiler/cljs-files-in can match dirs ([#270](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/270)).
- Fix bug in the build API caused by requiring `cljs.spec.test.alpha` ([#273](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/273)).
- Fix compilation crash with macros & `:optimize-constants true` ([#274](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/274)).

## [1.8.0-beta](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/compare/1.7.0...1.8.0-beta) (2017-09-16)

### New features

- Get arglists from the runtime environment ([#248](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/248)).
- Honor `*main-cli-fn*` ([#238](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/238)).
- Completions for JS namespaces ([#254](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/254)).
- Comprehensive enhancement to the Lumo build API ([#263](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/263)).
The Lumo build API has been enhanced significantly and now includes JS module
processing, preloads, and is mostly at feature parity with the JVM ClojureScript
build API.
One noteworthy feature is the possibility of passing a callback to
`lumo.build.api/build`: Lumo compilation is intrinsically asynchronous,
therefore now it is possible to pass a callback.

### Changes

- Treat stdin as file (doesn't print results by default) ([#231](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/231)).

### Bug fixes

- Fix `cljs.core/*command-line-args*` not getting populated ([#237](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/237)).
- Crash when getting completions for a namespace that was required as string ([#246](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/246)).
- Fix `load-file` switching back to default namespace ([#236](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/236)).
- Can't require `goog` ([#227](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/227)).
- Build API: namespaces compiled more than once ([#245](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/245)).
- Error in build API when building with source maps on ([#132](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/132)).

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/compare/1.6.0...1.7.0) (2017-08-16)

### New features

- Add support for tagged literals ([#75](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/75)).
- Add support for running custom accept functions in the Lumo socket server
([#105](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/105)).
The `--socket-repl` option can now be a JSON object with `accept` and `args` keys
(in addition to `port` and `host`) where `accept` is a namespace qualified string
for a function that will run when accepting a new connection.
- Add support for specifying Closure libraries in the `:libs` entry in `deps.cljs`
([#210](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/210)).
- Add `lumo.core/exit` function.
- Pretty print JavaScript objects & arrays.
- Add a new `-A / --checked-arrays` command line option that can be `warn` or `error`.
- Miscellaneous improvements to pretty printing at the REPL.

### Changes

- Use Paredit.js to calculate indentation for multiline forms ([#193](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/193)).
- Upgrade Google Closure Compiler to v20170806.
- Upgrade ClojureScript to version 1.9.908.
- Upgrade Node.js to version 8.4.0.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `lumo.core/*command-line-args*` in favor of the new `cljs.core/*command-line-args*`
introduced in ClojureScript 1.9.8XX.

### Bug fixes

- Isolate copy paste inference per readline session ([#197](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/197)).
- Socket REPL fails to isolate NS ([#158](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/158)).
- Fix NPM installation as root ([#206](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/206)).
- Deduplicate the results of `lumo.repl/apropos`.
- Fix issue that prevented `*print-namespace-maps*` to be `true` on REPL startup.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/compare/1.5.0...1.6.0) (2017-06-30)

### New features

- Add ability to execute a script from standard input ([#168](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/168)).
- Add support for `reverse-i-search` ([#169](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/169)).
- Expose `eval`. There is now a `lumo.core/eval` function ([#146](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/146), [#177](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/177)).
- Add support for passing Maven coordinates to add JARs to the classpath ([#156](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/156) and [#186](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/186)).
The relevant CLI option is `-D / --dependencies` that supports a comma-separated
list of Maven coordinates, and `-L / --local-repo` to override the local Maven
repository (defaults to `~/.m2/repository`).
- Bundle `cljs.spec.test.alpha` ([#179](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/179)).
Note that while this namespace is now bundled with Lumo, it has a hard dependency
on [`test.check`](https://github.com/clojure/test.check) (>= v0.10.0-alpha1).

### Changes

- Upgrade ClojureScript to version 1.9.671.
- Upgrade Node.js to version 8.1.3.
- Upgrade Google Closure Compiler to v20170521 ([#173](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/173)).
- Don't compile a fully static binary under Linux ([#163](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/163), [#176](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/176)). This fixes
a problem where requiring Node packages would crash (different stdlib versions).
It also means that Lumo no longer works under NixOS.

### Bug fixes

- Fix regression that prevented requiring binary modules ([#163](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/163)).
- Fix bug that prevented Lumo from continuing executing after being put in background ([#166](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/166)).
- Fix regression that prevented requiring foreign libraries ([#167](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/167)).
- Fix a race condition with the REPL history where Lumo could attempt to read a file's
size before it was created.
- Pretty print eductions ([#170](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/170)).
- Auto-complete after arrow & other special characters ([#157](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/157)).
- Don't print `doc` for macros that are not referred ([#153](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/153)).
- Correctly set __dirname and __filename when running script file ([#185](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/185)).
- Also Crawl `deps.cljs` files in dirs ([#184](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/184)).
- Suppress printing metadata for unknown types ([#189](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/189)).
- Fix brace highlighting for forms that span more than the terminal width ([#187](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/187)).

### New features

- Return exit code `1` on exception ([#58](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/58)).

- Make the classpath dynamic, add a new namespace `lumo.classpath` to interact
with the Lumo classpath ([#31](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/31)).

### Changes

- Print namespaced maps at the REPL.
- Do not print empty line if input is empty or whitespace only  (make behavior
consistent with `clojure.main`).

### Changes

- Upgrade to ClojureScript 1.9.456 ([#71](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/71)).

### Bug fixes

- Regression where specifying a main script to be executed would print the banner
as if entering the REPL.
- Fix the semantics of the transformation of the load path into a classpath path
when using the `load` REPL special ([#49](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/49)).

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/compare/1.0.0-alpha3...1.0.0) (2016-11-22)

### New features

- Highlight the matching brace when inserting a closing brace.
- TCP socket REPL ([#24](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/pull/24)).
- REPL editing autocompletion.
- Add a `-m / --main` command line option that specifies a namespace in the
classpath in which to call a `-main` function with all args after it ([#27](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/issues/27)).
- Add a `-a / --elide-asserts` command option that defines whether asserts in
